# Using LambdaBuffers

LambdaBuffers heavily relies on Nix to orchestrate code generation and dependency management.
If you don't have Nix installed with flakes enabled, please refer to the
[Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide.

To set up a project with LambdaBuffers and multi-language stack, refer to our demo project at [lambda-for-cardano](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers-for-cardano).

To see, how LambdaBuffers code is transpiled into other languages, see:

- [LambdaBuffers to Haskell](haskell.md)
- [LambdaBuffers to Purescript](purescript.md)
- [LambdaBuffers to Plutarch](plutarch.md)
- [LambdaBuffers to Rust](rust.md)
