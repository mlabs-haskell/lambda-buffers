# Catalyst milestone 5 (FINAL): Project scaffold for Rust, Javascript and Aiken

## Outputs

- [ ] A documented project scaffold that demonstrates the end-to-end use of LambdaBuffers with Rust, Javascript and Aiken language ecosystems.
- [ ] Demonstrate how to use LambdaBuffers to manage and exchange JSON-based configuration between different language ecosystems supported by LambdaBuffers.
- [ ] More importantly, demonstrates how to use LambdaBuffers to specify and exchange Plutus Datum between Plutus scripting languages and transaction-building frameworks.
- [ ] A fully tested and documented LambdaBuffers support for Rust, Javascript and Aiken language ecosystems.
- [ ] A documented scaffold project that serves to demonstrate how to use LambdaBuffers with the newly supported languages for easy adoption.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A LambdaBuffers scaffold repository is made available that demonstrates a working end-to-end use of LambdaBuffers with Rust, Javascript and Aiken language ecosystems.
- [ ] The scaffold uses LambdaBuffers to specify JSON configuration.
- [ ] The scaffold uses LambdaBuffers to specify Plutus Datum.

## Evidence of Milestone Completion

- [ ] The completed and reviewed LambdaBuffers scaffold project that uses LambdaBuffers to specify and exchange JSON based configuration between Rust, Javascript and Aiken language ecosystems.
- [ ] The completed and reviewed LambdaBuffers scaffold project that uses LambdaBuffers to specify and exchange Plutus Datums between Rust, Javascript and Aiken language ecosystems.
- [ ] We will record a video demonstrating the LambdaBuffers toolkit, how LambdaBuffers schemas are written and checked, and how code is generated from them in the newly supported programming languages.
- [ ] We will publish a fully documented scaffold project that demonstrates how LambdaBuffers is used in Cardano dApp projects.
