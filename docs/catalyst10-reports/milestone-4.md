# Catalyst milestone 4: Aiken support

## Outputs

- [ ] A LambdaBuffers code generation module that outputs type definitions and derived implementations in the Aiken programming language given a LambdaBuffers schema.
- [ ] An Aiken library that implements the LambdaBuffers Plutus runtime. This module would include standardised PlutusData encoding implementations for all declared type class instances in the Plutus schema.
- [ ] An Aiken test suite that assures the manually implemented and automatically generated implementations are consistent with the predefined LambdaBuffers Plutus golden data set of PlutusData encoded files and perform correct implementation derivation.
- [ ] Nix devops modules (Nix API) for streamlining the LambdaBuffers code generation pipeline to Aiken.
- [ ] Documentation on LambdaBuffers usage patterns for Aiken.
      NOTE: Milestone 4 carries the greatest amount of technical risk in this project. In the event that the outcome of Milestone 3 results in this milestone becoming infeasible, we will submit a Change Request form opting for a suitable alternative of similar scope.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] LambdaBuffers schemas that are based on the LambdaBuffers Plutus module can be used in Aiken projects to specify application types.
- [ ] The documentation and devops tooling is available to facilitate easy adoption.

## Evidence of Milestone Completion

- [ ] The completed and reviewed LambdaBuffers Plutus runtime library is available for the Aiken programming language.
- [ ] The completed and reviewed LambdaBuffers Plutus test suite is available and is passing in CI for the Aiken programming language.
- [ ] The completed and reviewed Nix API for LambdaBuffers Aiken support is available.
- [ ] The completed and reviewed LambdaBuffers for Aiken documentation is available.
