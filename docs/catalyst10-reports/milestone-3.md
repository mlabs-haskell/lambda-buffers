# Catalyst milestone 3: Aiken integration research and development

## Outputs

- [ ] Document describing Aiken integration and how PlutusData encodings can be provided by the LambdaBuffers toolkit.
      NOTE: We cannot ignore the fact that the outcome of the research done in Milestone 3 could point to incompatibilities that make an Aiken integration with LambdaBuffers infeasible. Should that be the case, an in-depth technical explanation of the limitations will be provided.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The generated document describes all the technical components relevant to the integration of Aiken with Lambda Buffers, showing a good understanding of them and how they would be relevant to the intended integration.
- [ ] The generated document describes a clear technical path to integrate Aiken with Lambda buffers and, in addition or alternatively, an in-depth analysis of any limitations found.

## Evidence of Milestone Completion

- [ ] The completed and reviewed "LambdaBuffers for Aiken - PlutusData encoding implementation provider" documentation is available.
- [ ] Alternatively, if Aiken integration proves to be infeasible:
- [ ] The completed and reviewed documentation describing the Aiken limitations and their impact is available.
