# Catalyst milestone 3: Aiken integration research and development

## Outputs

- [x] Document describing Aiken integration and how PlutusData encodings can be provided by the Lambda Buffers toolkit.
      NOTE: We cannot ignore the fact that the outcome of the research done in Milestone 3 could point to incompatibilities that make an Aiken integration with Lambda Buffers infeasible. Should that be the case, an in-depth technical explanation of the limitations will be provided.
  - The document can be found [here](../aiken-integration.md).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The generated document describes all the technical components relevant to the integration of Aiken with Lambda Buffers, showing a good understanding of them and how they would be relevant to the intended integration.
  - The document discusses relevant technical components of Aiken integration with Lambda Buffers.
- [x] The generated document describes a clear technical path to integrate Aiken with Lambda buffers and, in addition or alternatively, an in-depth analysis of any limitations found.
  - The document discusses limitations of Aiken and its incompatibilities with Lambda Buffers along with workarounds when possible.

## Evidence of Milestone Completion

- [x] The completed and reviewed "Lambda Buffers for Aiken - PlutusData encoding implementation provider" documentation is available.
  - Methods to workaround the incompatibilities of Aiken and Lambda Buffers where possible are provided in the document.
- [x] Alternatively, if Aiken integration proves to be infeasible:
- [x] The completed and reviewed documentation describing the Aiken limitations and their impact is available.
  - The discussion of the limitations and whether they are worthwhile are also included in the document.

## Demo files

- [x] The document *[Aiken Research Document](../aiken-integration.md)* addresses these outputs.
