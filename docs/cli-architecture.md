# LambdaBuffers CLI architecture

LambdaBuffers consists of three runtime command line interface components:

- [lambda-buffers-frontend-cli](lambda-buffers-frontend-cli)
- [lambda-buffers-compiler-cli](lambda-buffers-compiler-cli)
- [lambda-buffers-codegen-cli](todo-link)

The Frontend CLI orchestrates work between the user and the Compiler and Codegen components.
