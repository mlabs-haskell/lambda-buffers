# LambdaBuffers for Plutarch

[Plutarch](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch-plutus) is a typed eDSL in Haskell for writing efficient Plutus Core validators.

LambdaBuffers creates Plutarch type definitions and associated Plutarch type class implementations for [PlutusType](#plutustype), [PIsData](#pisdata) and [PShow](#pshow) classes.

Additionally, when instructed by a LambdaBuffers `derive` statement type class implementations for [PEq](#peq) and [PTryFrom](#ptryfrom) are also printed.

A small example:

```shell
❯ nix develop github:mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers#dev-plutarch
❯ cat > Example.lbf
module Example

import Prelude
import Plutus.V1 (PlutusData, AssetClass)

record Example a = {
  foo : AssetClass,
  bar : a
  }

derive Eq (Example a)
derive Json (Example a)
derive PlutusData (Example a)

❯ lbf-plutus-to-plutarch Example.lbf
[lbf][INFO] Compilation OK
[lbf][INFO] Codegen OK

❯ find autogen/
autogen/
autogen/build.json
autogen/LambdaBuffers
autogen/LambdaBuffers/Example
autogen/LambdaBuffers/Example/Plutarch.hs
```

For a full example see [Example](#example).

## LambdaBuffers modules

Writing .lbf schemas with API types intended for Plutarch backend will typically use the following LambdaBuffers schema modules:

1. [Prelude](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-prelude/Prelude.lbf),
2. [Plutus.V1](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-plutus/Plutus/V1.lbf),
3. [Plutus.V2](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-plutus/Plutus/V2.lbf).

Take a look at [Example.lbf](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/docs/plutarch/api/Example.lbf) schema as an example.

## Haskell libraries

The necessary LambdaBuffers runtime libraries a typical Plutarch project needs when working with LambdaBuffers:

1. [lbr-plutarch](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/runtimes/haskell/lbr-plutarch) a Haskell runtime library necessary for working with `lbf-xyz` libraries.
2. [lbf-prelude-plutarch](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-prelude) that contains the [LambdaBuffers Prelude](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-prelude) schema library generated by LambdaBuffers.
3. [lbf-plutus-plutarch](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-plutus) that contains the [LambdaBuffers Plutus](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-plutus) schema library generated by LambdaBuffers.

Of course, additional imports for Plutarch libraries are also necessary [plutarch](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch-plutus) and optionally [plutarch-extra](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch-plutus/tree/master/plutarch-extra).

For a full example see [Example](#example).

### Inspecting the generated output

You can inspect the generated libraries using Nix:

```shell
❯ nix build .#lbf-prelude-plutarch
❯ find result/autogen/
result/autogen/
result/autogen/LambdaBuffers
result/autogen/LambdaBuffers/Prelude
result/autogen/LambdaBuffers/Prelude/Plutarch.hs

❯ nix build .#lbf-plutus-plutarch
❯ find result/autogen/
result/autogen/
result/autogen/LambdaBuffers
result/autogen/LambdaBuffers/Plutus
result/autogen/LambdaBuffers/Plutus/V2
result/autogen/LambdaBuffers/Plutus/V2/Plutarch.hs
result/autogen/LambdaBuffers/Plutus/V1
result/autogen/LambdaBuffers/Plutus/V1/Plutarch.hs
```

## Haskell modules

The set of imports a Plutarch program using LambdaBuffers would typically need is the following:

```haskell
import LambdaBuffers.Plutus.V1.Plutarch ()
import LambdaBuffers.Plutus.V2.Plutarch ()
import LambdaBuffers.Prelude.Plutarch ()
import LambdaBuffers.Runtime.Plutarch ()
import Plutarch ()
import Plutarch.Prelude ()
import Plutarch.Api.V1 ()
import Plutarch.Api.V2 ()
```

1. LambdaBuffers.Plutus.V1.Plutarch is a module generated from [Plutus.V1](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-plutus/Plutus/V1.lbf) LambdaBuffers schema and provided by the [lbf-plutus-plutarch](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-plutus) runtime library.
2. LambdaBuffers.Plutus.V2.Plutarch is a module generated from [Plutus.V2](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-plutus/Plutus/V2.lbf) LambdaBuffers schema and provided by the [lbf-plutus-plutarch](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-plutus) runtime library.
3. LambdaBuffers.Prelude.Plutarch is a module generated from [Prelude](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-prelude/Prelude.lbf) LambdaBuffers schema and provided by the [lbf-prelude-plutarch](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-prelude) runtime library.
4. LambdaBuffers.Runtime.Plutarch is a module provided by the [lbr-plutarch](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/runtimes/haskell/lbr-plutarch) runtime library.

> Generated Plutarch module for a LambdaBuffers schema `Foo/Bar.lbf` (ie. `Foo.Bar`) is stored at `Foo/Bar/Plutarch.hs`

## Restrictions

Plutarch backend doesn't support recursive type definitions unfortunately (see #131).

The following will not work:

```lbf
module ModuleWithRecursiveType

import Prelude (Eq)
import Plutus.V1 (PlutusData)

sum List a = Cons a (List a) | Nil
derive Eq (List a)
derive PlutusData (List a)
```

Additionally, LambdaBuffers record types are mapped to Plutarch product types:

```lbf
module ModuleWithARecordType

import Prelude (Eq, Integer, Bool)
import Plutus.V1 (PlutusData)

record Foo = {
  bar: Integer,
  baz: Bool
  }
derive Eq Foo
derive PlutusData Foo
```

Essentially, the record definitions are 'degraded' into product types such that the order of product fields is the order of record fields as they are defined at source.

For example the `Foo` record defined above would have no difference in Plutarch if it was defined as product `Foo` below:

```lbf
prod Foo = Integer Bool
```

The Plutarch backend doesn't support the use of `Char`, `Text`, `Bytes` (there's a Plutus.V1.Bytes), `Set` and `Map` (there's a Plutus.V1.Map) from [LambdaBuffers Prelude](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-prelude/Prelude.lbf) module.

## Plutarch

### Type definition mapping

Plutarch backend supports all types from the [LambdaBuffers Plutus](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-plutus) schema library, as to enable full featured Plutus script development.

Additionally, it also supports some types from the [LambdaBuffers Prelude](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/libs/lbf-prelude) schema library, namely `Bool`, `Integer`, `Maybe`, `Either` and `List`.

```lbf
module Foo

sum Sum = Some a | Nothing

record Record a = {
  foo : Bytes,
  bar: a
}

prod Product a = Bytes a
```

translates into Plutarch equivalent:

```haskell
module LambdaBuffers.Foo.Plutarch (Sum(..), Record(..), Product(..)) where

import qualified LambdaBuffers.Plutus.V1.Plutarch
import qualified LambdaBuffers.Prelude.Plutarch
import qualified LambdaBuffers.Runtime.Plutarch
import qualified Plutarch
import qualified Plutarch.Bool
import qualified Plutarch.Builtin
import qualified Plutarch.Internal.PlutusType
import qualified Plutarch.Prelude
import qualified Plutarch.Show
import qualified Plutarch.TryFrom
import qualified Plutarch.Unsafe

data Sum (a :: PType) (s :: Plutarch.S) = Sum'Some (Plutarch.Term s (Plutarch.Builtin.PAsData LambdaBuffers.Plutus.V1.Plutarch.Bytes)) (Plutarch.Term s (Plutarch.Builtin.PAsData PAsData))
                                  | Sum'Nothing
  deriving stock GHC.Generics.Generic
  deriving anyclass Plutarch.Show.PShow

data Record (a :: PType) (s :: Plutarch.S) = Record (Plutarch.Term s (Plutarch.Builtin.PAsData LambdaBuffers.Plutus.V1.Plutarch.Bytes)) (Plutarch.Term s (Plutarch.Builtin.PAsData PAsData))
  deriving stock GHC.Generics.Generic
  deriving anyclass Plutarch.Show.PShow

data Product (a :: PType) (s :: Plutarch.S) = Product (Plutarch.Term s (Plutarch.Builtin.PAsData LambdaBuffers.Plutus.V1.Plutarch.Bytes)) (Plutarch.Term s (Plutarch.Builtin.PAsData PAsData))
  deriving stock GHC.Generics.Generic
  deriving anyclass Plutarch.Show.PShow
```

### Type class implementations

Plutarch has a couple of fundamental type classes essential to its operations namely, `PlutusType`, `PIsData`, `PTryFrom` and `PEq`.

#### PlutusType

Printing an implementation for this class for a particular type is governed by `derive Plutus.V1.PlutusData <type>` statements in .lbf schemas.

[PlutusType](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch-plutus/blob/c14ad83479706566fe22e7b7b50b696043326c8f/Plutarch/Internal/PlutusType.hs#L56) serves to (de)construct Plutarch eDSL terms from Haskell 'native' terms.

```haskell
class PlutusType (a :: PType) where
  type PInner a :: PType
  pcon' :: forall s. a s -> Term s (PInner a)
  pmatch' :: forall s b. Term s (PInner a) -> (a s -> Term s b) -> Term s b
```

Additionally, Plutarch enables specifying terms to have different 'value' representation, like Scott encoded terms or PlutusData encoded terms.
This is what the `PInner` type family is used to specify.
LambdaBuffers only cares about `PlutusData` encoded terms since we're using it to specify Plutus datum structures.

The task is to generate a `pcon'` implementation such that we can construct Plutarch `Term`s that have some `PInner` representation of type `PData`, from Haskell 'native' values.
The `pcon'` implementation must match the LB Plutus PlutusData encoding class standard, and so we'll use the same 'to Plutus data' specification to generate `pcon'` implementations.

Constructing is always only one part of the story, there's also deconstruction that is captured by the `pmatch'` method.
This method serves to 'pattern match' on a value that was already constructed using `pcon'` and dispatch said value to a provided continuation function.
It's important to note that there's a subtle but important distinction to be made between the `ptryFrom` and `pmatch'` methods.
`pmatch'` assumes that the value it receives is indeed correct, as it was constructed using the `pcon'` method.
This means that `pmatch'` should never error, and if it does that means the implementation is wrong.
`ptryFrom` is different, as it takes some `PData` and tries to parse it into a `PType`, but can fail.

However, in LambdaBuffers, both of these methods follow the exact same logical pattern, and they correspond and can be generated using the `from Plutus data` specification.

#### PTryFrom

Printing an implementation for this class for a particular type is governed by `derive Plutus.V1.PlutusData <type>` statements in .lbf schemas.

[PTryFrom](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch-plutus/blob/c14ad83479706566fe22e7b7b50b696043326c8f/Plutarch/TryFrom.hs#L73) serves specify how `PData` is 'parsed' into a Plutarch type.
N
It's generally used to convert between Plutarch types, but that's a fairly general use case, and we generally use this class in a very narrow form to specify how `PData` is 'parsed' into a Plutarch type.

```haskell
class PSubtype a b => PTryFrom (a :: PType) (b :: PType) where
  type PTryFromExcess a b :: PType
  type PTryFromExcess a b = PTryFromExcess a (PInner b)
  ptryFrom' :: forall s r. Term s a -> ((Term s b, Reduce (PTryFromExcess a b s)) -> Term s r) -> Term s r
  default ptryFrom' :: forall s r. (PTryFrom a (PInner b), PTryFromExcess a b ~ PTryFromExcess a (PInner b)) => Term s a -> ((Term s b, Reduce (PTryFromExcess a b s)) -> Term s r) -> Term s r
  ptryFrom' opq f = ptryFrom @(PInner b) @a opq \(inn, exc) -> f (punsafeCoerce inn, exc)
```

There's some additionally features exhibited by this type class, most noteworthy is the `PTryFromExcess` type family that enables us specify the part of the structure that wasn't parsed and is left unexamined.
It's a form of optimization that becomes very important if you have a very complex data type such as `ScriptContext` from the `plutus-ledger-api`.

Apparently, a good intuition pump for this 'excess' business is that of a [zipper](https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/huet-zipper.pdf).
We focus on a certain part of a data structure, only ever providing links to other parts that are left un-examined.

LambdaBuffers doesn't use this feature and sets the `PTryFromExcess` to a unit type, signaling that nothing is left unexamined.

#### PIsData

Printing an implementation for this class for a particular type is governed by `derive Plutus.V1.PlutusData <type>` statements in .lbf schemas.

[PIsData](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch-plutus/blob/c14ad83479706566fe22e7b7b50b696043326c8f/Plutarch/Builtin.hs#L354) serves to track 'is it Plutus data encoded?' with types.

```haskell
newtype PAsData (a :: PType) (s :: S) = PAsData (Term s a)

class PIsData a where
  pfromDataImpl :: Term s (PAsData a) -> Term s a
  default pfromDataImpl :: PIsData (PInner a) => Term s (PAsData a) -> Term s a
  pfromDataImpl x = punsafeDowncast $ pfromDataImpl (punsafeCoerce x :: Term _ (PAsData (PInner a)))

  pdataImpl :: Term s a -> Term s PData
  default pdataImpl :: PIsData (PInner a) => Term s a -> Term s PData
  pdataImpl x = pdataImpl $ pto x
```

```haskell
instance PIsData FooTrivial where
  pdataImpl = punsafeCoerce
  pfromDataImpl = punsafeCoerce

instance PEq FooTrivial where
  (#==) = \l r -> pdata l #== pdata r
```

> Due to generated types having a `PAsData` attached to them, be ready to use `pdata` and `pfromData` to switch between forms.

#### PEq

Printing an implementation for this class for a particular type is governed by `derive Prelude.Eq <type>` statements in .lbf schemas.

[PEq](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch-plutus/blob/c14ad83479706566fe22e7b7b50b696043326c8f/Plutarch/Bool.hs#L74) serves to track provide equality checks to Plutarch types.

```haskell
class PEq t where
  (#==) :: Term s t -> Term s t -> Term s PBool
  default (#==) ::
    (PGeneric t, PlutusType t, All2 PEq (PCode t)) =>
    Term s t ->
    Term s t ->
    Term s PBool
  a #== b = gpeq # a # b

infix 4 #==
```

> We don't generate an implementation from the LambdaBuffers 'equality spec', rather we delegate the equality check to the underlying 'PData' representations that all generated types have for performance.

#### PShow

All generated types have a PShow instance derived using the internal Plutarch deriving mechanism.

[PShow](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch-plutus/blob/c14ad83479706566fe22e7b7b50b696043326c8f/Plutarch/Show.hs#L52) serves to stringify Plutarch types which is very useful during debugging.

## Example

Let work through the [Plutarch example](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/docs/plutarch) available in the repo.

First, please check the [Getting started](getting-started.md) guide on how to prepare to work with the repo and setup Nix.

Let's see what we have here:

```shell
lambda-buffers/docs/plutarch ❯ find
.
./build.nix
./cabal.project
./hie.yaml
./plutarch-example.cabal
./app
./app/Example.hs
./api
./api/Example.lbf
./.envrc
```

The salient bits we should focus on are:

1. The LambdaBuffers .lbf schema in [./api/Example.lbf](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/docs/plutarch/api/Example.lbf) that describes the API types used by our little program,
2. The Haskell Plutarch program in [./app/Example.hs](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/docs/plutarch/app/Example.hs) that works with the API types.

To inspect the generated library:

```shell
lambda-buffers/docs/plutarch ❯ nix build .#lbf-plutarch-example-api
lambda-buffers/docs/plutarch ❯ find autogen/
autogen/
autogen/build.json
autogen/LambdaBuffers
autogen/LambdaBuffers/Example
autogen/LambdaBuffers/Example/Plutarch.hs
```

> The name of the generated library `lbf-plutarch-example-api` is set in the ./plutarch/build.nix Nix build file.

However, it's not expected for users to need to do this. If you have any issue please reach out.

Inspecting the [Cabal file](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/docs/plutarch/plutarch-example.cabal) shows the standard runtime libraries we need:

```shell
lambda-buffers/docs/plutarch ❯ cabal info .
* plutarch-example-0.1.0.0 (program)
    Synopsis:      LambdaBuffers Plutarch example

                   text >=1.2
    Cached:        Yes
```

Run the program:

```shell
lambda-buffers/docs/plutarch ❯ cabal run
"Friends, peace and love!!!"
```

Take a look at the [Example.hs](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/lambda-buffers/tree/main/docs/plutarch/app/Example.hs) to see how generated types are used, namely how they are constructed with `pcon` and deconstructed with `pmatch` (or `pmatchC`).
